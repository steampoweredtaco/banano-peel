Prototype browser extension to provide easy donate functionality to sites and content creators of the banano coin network.

To build you need npm and the following should work
```powershell
npm install
npm build
```
Then public/ should be deployable as an extension in chrome.  It should work with mozilla based browsers as well and possibly edge and webkit (those are currently untested).
